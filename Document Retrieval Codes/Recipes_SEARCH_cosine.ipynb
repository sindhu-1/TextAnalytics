Continue to simmer very gently for 20–30 minutes, until the flavours are well infused. It's important not to allow it to boil at any stage. Pour into a squeezy bottle, leaving the bits in, as the flavours will continue to infuse.

Remove from the heat and cool., Can be used as a cold dipping sauce or heated up and tossed with steamed vegetables.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
